                other policies of any such third party website may differ materially from this Policy.

            <p>
                We strongly recommend that clients review the privacy policies of any such third party prior to
                submitting personally identifiable information. We have no control over and are not responsible for the

                to us.
            </p>
            <p>Third party sites are governed by their own privacy policies.</p>
            <p>
                Use of Widgets. We may provide widgets on our Sites that make it possible to share information on
                third-party platforms. These widgets do not store your personally identifiable information. Our Sites
                may also include social media features, such as the Facebook® or Twitter® button and similar widgets and
                interactive mini-programs that run on our Sites (each, a “Feature”). To the extent we use these
                Features, they may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Sites, and may set a
                cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social media Features and widgets are either hosted
                by a third party or hosted directly on our Sites. Your interactions with these Features are governed by
                the privacy statement of the company providing the Feature or widget.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any features, widgets or mini-programs provided by or for social media sites or other third parties may
                collect personal information and are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use of Cookies. When you interact with the Sites, we try to make that experience simple and meaningful.
                When you visit our Sites, our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that web
                browsers place on a computer’s hard drive and are used to indicate whether you have visited the Sites
                previously. The data collected may include how you navigate around a web page and the most commonly
                clicked links on a specific web page. Certain technical information, such as your browser version and
                operating system, are also collected. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all
                cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set (each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your
                browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences). We use cookies for a number of purposes,
                including to: access a client’s account information when a client logs into a Site, so that we can
                provide the client with customized content, keep track of preferences you specify while you are using
                the Services, and to estimate and report total audience size (unique users) and traffic for our Sites,
                and to conduct research to improve the content and services of our Sites.<br/>
                Our Sites use cookies. Your browser probably lets you control whether it allows the use of
                cookies.<br/>
                Web Beacons.<br/>
                We may use web beacons to access cookies and count users who visit our Sites or open our HTML-formatted
                email messages. Web beacons are single-pixel graphic files with a unique identifier, similar to cookies.
                Web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages and emails and are stored on a user’s hard drive. You
                can modify your browser settings to control web beacons.<br/>
                Third-Party Cookies. We may also from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze
                non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to our Sites to help
                us administer our Sites and improve their quality. Such third parties may use cookies and web beacons to
                help track visitor behavior. Such cookies and web beacons may track how you interact with a Site through
                the use of cookies and the data collected may include how you navigate around a web page and the most
                commonly clicked links on a specific web page. Certain technical information, such as your browser
                version and operating system, may also be collected. If collected, this information will be used by us
                to evaluate and, if necessary, modify the relevant Site to improve the functions and ultimately, make it
                easier for clients to use. None of your personally identifiable information, that is, your name,
                address, or phone number, is collected through such collections.<br/>
                We may engage third parties to help us run our Sites. These third parties may also use cookies and web
                beacons.

            <p>
                Behavioral Targeting/Re-Targeting.<br/>
                We may partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our Sites or to manage our
                advertising on other websites. Any such ad network partners may use cookies and web beacons to collect
                non-personally identifiable information about your activities on our Sites and other websites to provide
                you targeted advertising based upon your interests. To opt out of this type of cookies, visit the
                Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) website by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
                Even if you opt out through the NAI website, you can still receive communications you have signed up to
                receive from us unless you opt out of those by using the information in the “Opting Out” section of this
                Policy.<br/>
                Our advertising partners may also use cookies and web beacons to provide you targeted advertising.

                Governing Law; Superseding Contract Terms. By choosing to visit and interact with our website, you agree
                that your visit and any dispute regarding the protection of your privacy during such visit is subject to
                this Policy and the choice of law and dispute resolution provisions in our separate terms of use and/or
                Service Terms applicable to the Services relating to the dispute. To the extent a client enters into
                other contractual agreements with us, the privacy terms and conditions of such agreements (including the
                separate Service Terms applicable to the use of our Platform) supplement or supersede portions of this
                Policy to the extent of any inconsistency between this Policy and such agreements. Please note that the
                nature of the marketing and sales services provided by our Platforms means that clients using the
                Platform will frequently and routinely make your personally identifying information available to third
                parties or the public as part of the ordinary operation of the Platform. This disclosure may take place
                on Facebook and other social media channels.<br/>
                Our other terms and agreements with you control dispute resolution and may have different privacy terms.

                information available to the public.<br/>
                Revisions or Changes. We reserve the right to change this Policy and other policies prospectively at any
                time, subject to applicable laws and regulations, by posting a revised Policy on the Sites. Regardless
                of later updates or changes to our Policy, we will never use the information you submit under our
                current Policy in a new way without first providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prevent
                such use.<br/>
                We can change this Policy from time to time.
            <p>
