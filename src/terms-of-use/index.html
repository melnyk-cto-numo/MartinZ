                default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. To

                We may correct errors in the Content but are not obligated to do so.<br/>
                c. Enforcement/ Choice of Law/ Choice of Forum. If any part of these Terms of Use is determined by a
                court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, it will not impact any other provision
                of these Terms of Use, all of which will remain in full force and effect. Any and all disputes relating
                to these Terms of Use, truehomevalues.ca’s Privacy Policy, your use of the Site, any other

                truehomevalues.ca’s Privacy Policy, your use of the Site, any other truehomevalues.ca web site or the
                Content, except that truehomevalues.ca reserves the right to seek or enforce injunctive or other
                equitable relief in any court with jurisdiction.<br/>
                These Terms of Use and your use of the Site and Content are subject to Massachusetts law and
                courts.<br/>
