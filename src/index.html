                        Martin took his time with us and listened carefully to our needs. He actually convinced us not
                        to
                        sell, but instead refinance our home based on our circumstances.

                        After 34 years of my wife and I being in the same home, selling was a very difficult decision -
                        and
                        finding the right agent to sell our home was even more difficult. Martin was very considerate of
                        our
                        situation, he listened to our needs and executed a plan that surpassed both our expectations.
                        After
                        6 days on the market and three offers on the table, Martin sold our home above asking.

                        It was a pleasure to work with Martin on the sale of my property. I appreciated his
                        professionalism
                        and the valuable advice that he provided throughout the sale process. In the end, Martin was
                        able to
                        bring me two offers within one week of listing, and my property sold for over the asking price.
                        Well
                        done!
